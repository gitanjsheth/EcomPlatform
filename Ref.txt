Applied Software Project


Abstract
The abstract for an applied software project should succinctly summarize its title,
purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. 

Since it is a technical project, focus on its real-life applications in the society or how such software
tools can be applied to modify existing processes for better outcomes in different industries.

Aim for conciseness, usually limiting it to under 300 words, to effectively convey the
project's essence.
Project Description
Describe the project, Outline the objectives and explain its relevance. 
Use Pictures, flow diagrams to illustrate the project well

Use the below format as reference when including a picture

 
Figure 1.1: Project Development Process  (Figure captions go below figures.)

Requirement Gathering

●	Describe the requirements - Functional, Non-Functional Requirements
●	Describe the Users and Use Cases
○	Include detailed Use Case Diagram / Images to illustrate
●	List and detail out the Feature set - 
○	Use Tables to list out the feature set


Use the below format as reference when including a table

Table 1.1: < Table caption > (Table captions go above tables.)

		
		
		

Class Diagrams

Describe the Low Level Design of the Project… 

Provide class diagrams - Provide proper captions and follow the proper format for including diagrams / figures / images

Tip - Make images using draw.io and paste here following the guidelines for adding images / figures
Database Schema Design

Explain the Low Level Design of the Project in more detail by providing the database schema
design description

Provide the schema design textually as well as diagrammatically

Sample Schema Design described textually -

Feature Development Process

Pick One key feature - Talk about its development process, implementation and performance optimisation / metric optimisation achieved…

For example, ‘Book a seat’ feature in developing ‘BookMyShow’ app

Elaborate the request flow to backend
a)	API Request Payload
b)	Service which picks the request
c)	Flow of MVC architecture

Explain the performance improvement / metric optimization achieved.

For example, 
●	Used Cache to reduce API Response time by X seconds…
●	Optimized Query Response time by using Indexing…

Benchmarking of response time without the optimisation and post the optimisation


Deployment Flow

Explain how the deployment will work via AWS (Describe the below) - 
●	EC2
●	VPC
●	Security Groups
●	RDS
●	Cache
●	Managed Infra / Elastic Beanstalk

Use diagrams, images to explain better
Technologies Used
Kafka, MySQL, Springboot, Cloud etc…
●	For each key technology used in building the project, 
○	Detail and describe each of them
○	Elaborate how they can be used in real life
○	Provide example of real-life applications using them

Use diagrams, images to explain better

Tip - Use the internet to improve your project but DO NOT PLAGIARIZE - Include proper references if you are quoting articles from the internet

Conclusion
The Conclusion should include some key points as elaborated below - 

●	Key Takeaways: Highlight the important concepts and technologies learned from doing the Project
●	Practical Applications : Significance of technologies with their real-world applications
●	Limitations : Limitations of the technologies, cost implications and suggestions for improvement
